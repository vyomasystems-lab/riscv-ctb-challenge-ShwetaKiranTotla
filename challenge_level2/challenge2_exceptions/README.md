# Exceptions generation explaination
To generate 10 exceptions in the `exception-generation` section, we specify the desired number for each exception cause.  
Since we need 10 exceptions in total, a value of 1 for 10 different `ecause` (exception causes) or any other combination such that the total number of exceptions is 10 can be set. 
Specifically, I have used ecause04 and ecause06 for exception generation.
